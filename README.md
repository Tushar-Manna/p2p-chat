# p2p-chat

--------
28-02-2025

I am trying to make an p2p chat application, the main goal of this project is to make it as private and as secure as possible.

The initial version will be and web app. I am using nextjs for the frontend and experimenting with WebRTC to build the backend. I will keep updating about the project on this readme until I make things work and deploy the initial working version.
